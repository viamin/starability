# Change Log
All changes will be listed here (since version v.0.1.0)
Project uses [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [2.0.0] - 2017-06-12
### Changed
- The library does not rely on the reversed order of inputs any more. This means that arrow keys are moving the stars in the right direction. To make it work visually, there was a need for a small CSS hack (adding pseudoelement with a background covering the stars to the left to make them highlighted), but the library is more user-friendly and supports Accessibility better than ever. For projects with the HTML structure from the previous version: the library still behaves the same and works, but it is  better to update the inputs' order to get the correct arrow behaviour.
